# XSUAA Token Client and Token Flow API

## Motivation

This library serves as slim client for some XSUAA `/oauth/token` token endpoints as specified [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/api/uaa/version/74.1.0/index.html#token). 
Furthermore it introduces a new API to support the following token flows:

* **User Token Flow**.  
The idea behind a User Token exchange is to separate service-specific access scopes into separate tokens. For example, if Service A has scopes specific to its functionality and Service B has other scopes, the intention is that there is no single Jwt token that contains all of these scopes. As of version `2.5.1` the `grant_type`=`urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` is used ([RFC 7523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523)).
* **Client Credentials Flow**.  
The Client Credentials ([RFC 6749, section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)) is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of a user. It is used for non interactive applications (a CLI, a batch job, or for service-2-service communication) where the token is issued to the application itself, instead of an end user for accessing resources without principal propagation. 
* **Refresh Token Flow**.  
A Refresh Token ([RFC 6749, section 1.5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.5)) flow allows you to obtain a new access token in case the current one becomes invalid or expires.
* **Password Token Flow**.  
The Resource owner password credentials (i.e., username and password) can be used directly as an authorization grant to obtain an access token ([RFC 6749, section 1.3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-1.3.3)). The credentials should only be used when there is a high degree of trust between the resource owner and the client.

> Note: The **Authorization Code Grant Flow** involves the browser and is therefore triggered by an API gateway (e.g. Application Router). The other flows, however, may need to be triggered programmatically, e.g. to exchange one token for another or refresh a token, if it is about to expire. When you create a XSUAA service instance a OAuth client gets created and you receive the client credentials (client id and secret) when you bind your application with the XSUAA service instance. Having that in place you are ready to use the token flows in your Java application.

## Configuration for Java Applications

#### Maven Dependencies, when using Apache Http Client:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>token-client</artifactId>
    <version>2.10.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### XsuaaTokenFlows Initialization
Instantiate `XsuaaTokenFlows` with the `DefaultOAuth2TokenService` which
makes use of [Apache HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/):

The `DefaultOAuth2TokenService` should be instantiated with a custom `CloseableHttpClient`.

```java
XsuaaTokenFlows tokenFlows = new XsuaaTokenFlows(
                    new DefaultOAuth2TokenService(<CloseableHttpClient>), 
                    new XsuaaDefaultEndpoints(<OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>), // XsuaaDefaultEndpoints(url) is deprecated as of 2.10
                    <OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>.getClientIdentity()));
```
> The `<OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>` is a placeholder for the `OAuth2ServiceConfiguration` instance which holds the information from the XSUAA service binding. When using `spring-xsuaa` client library this is given with `XsuaaServiceConfiguration`.

> `<CloseableHttpClient>` is your custom configured Apache http client.

For X.509 based authentication method you can use preconfigured http client from `HttpClientFactory`, which [default implementation](/token-client/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/security/client/DefaultHttpClientFactory.java) is not recommended for productive use:
```java
XsuaaTokenFlows tokenFlows = new XsuaaTokenFlows(
                    new DefaultOAuth2TokenService(HttpClientFactory.create(<OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>.getClientIdentity())), 
                    new XsuaaDefaultEndpoints(<OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>), 
                    <OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>.getClientIdentity());
```

For X.509 based authentication method using an externally managed certificate you need to provide your own ``ClientCertificate`` in addition:
```java
ClientIdentity clientIdentity = new ClientCertificate(
                    <OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>.getCertificate(),
                    "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY ... END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----",
                    <OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>.getClientId());

XsuaaTokenFlows tokenFlows = new XsuaaTokenFlows(
                    new DefaultOAuth2TokenService(HttpClientFactory.create(clientIdentity)),
                    new XsuaaDefaultEndpoints(<OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>),
                    clientIdentity);
```


##### Cache

By default, the `DefaultOAuth2TokenService` caches tokens internally. The Cache can be configured by providing an
`CacheConfiguration` object as constructor parameter. The cache can be disabled by using the
`CacheConfiguration.CACHE_DISABLED` configuration.

:exclamation: In order to leverage the cache it makes sense to have only one reference to the `OAuth2TokenService.java` implementation or to the `XsuaaTokenFlows`.

## Configuration for Spring Applications

#### Maven Dependencies, when using Spring Web `RestTemplate`
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>token-client</artifactId>
    <version>2.10.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency> <!-- required when using Spring Web `RestTemplate` with X.509 authentication method-->
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### XsuaaTokenFlows Initialization
With Spring-Web available `XsuaaTokenFlows` can be instantiated with a `RestTemplate` of your choice like that:

```java
XsuaaTokenFlows tokenFlows = new XsuaaTokenFlows(
                    new XsuaaOAuth2TokenService(<RestOperations>),
                    new XsuaaDefaultEndpoints(<OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>), // XsuaaDefaultEndpoints(url) is deprecated as of 2.10
                    <OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>.getClientIdentity());
```
> The `<OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>` is a placeholder for the `OAuth2ServiceConfiguration` instance which holds the information from the XSUAA service binding. When using `spring-xsuaa` client library this is given with `XsuaaServiceConfiguration`.

> `<RestOperations>` is your custom configured Spring http client.


For X.509 based authentication method you can configure Spring's rest client using Apache's http client. You can use preconfigured http client from ```HttpClientFactory```, which [default implementation](/token-client/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/security/client/DefaultHttpClientFactory.java) is not recommended for productive use:

```java
// if <OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>.getClientIdentity().isCertificateBased() == true
HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory requestFactory = new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory();
requestFactory.setHttpClient(HttpClientFactory.create(<OAuth2ServiceConfiguration>.getClientIdentity()));
RestOperations restOperations = new RestTemplate(requestFactory);            
```

For X.509 based authentication method using an externally managed certificate, `ClientCertificate` class needs to be instantiated with the external key. For `spring-xsuaa` based applications it can be easily done by overriding these values in `application.yml properties file.
```yaml
# For externally managed X.509 certificate
xsuaa:
  key: -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----YOUR PRIVATE KEY-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

##### Cache

By default, the `XsuaaOAuth2TokenService` caches tokens internally. The Cache can be configured by providing an
`CacheConfiguration` object as constructor parameter. The cache can be disabled by using the
`CacheConfiguration.CACHE_DISABLED` configuration.

:exclamation: In order to leverage the cache it makes sense to have only one reference to the `OAuth2TokenService.java` implementation or to the `XsuaaTokenFlows`.

## Configuration for Spring Boot Applications

#### Maven Dependencies
In context of a Spring Boot application you may like to leverage auto-configuration:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.sap.cloud.security.xsuaa</groupId>
    <artifactId>xsuaa-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>2.10.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency> <!-- required when using Spring Web `RestTemplate` with X.509 authentication method-->
  <groupId>org.apache.httpcomponents</groupId>
  <artifactId>httpclient</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

#### Auto-configuration
As auto-configuration requires Spring Boot specific dependencies, it is enabled when using `xsuaa-spring-boot-starter` Spring Boot Starter. 
Then, xsuaa integration libraries auto-configures beans, that are required to initialize the Token Flows API.

Auto-configuration class | Description
---- | --------
[XsuaaAutoConfiguration](/spring-xsuaa/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/security/xsuaa/autoconfiguration/XsuaaAutoConfiguration.java) | Adds `xsuaa.*` properties to Spring's Environment. The properties are by default parsed from `VCAP_SERVICES` system environment variables and can be overwritten by properties such as `xsuaa.url` e.g. for testing purposes. Furthermore it exposes a `XsuaaServiceConfiguration` bean that can be used to access xsuaa service information.  Alternatively you can access them with `@Value` annotation e.g. `@Value("${xsuaa.url:}") String xsuaaBaseUrl`. As of version `1.7.0` it creates a default [`RestTemplate`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestOperations.html) bean that serves as Rest client that is used inside a default `OAuth2TokenService` to perform HTTP requests to the XSUAA server. **It is recommended to overwrite this default and configuring it with the HTTP client of your choice.**
[XsuaaTokenFlowAutoConfiguration](/spring-xsuaa/src/main/java/com/sap/cloud/security/xsuaa/autoconfiguration/XsuaaTokenFlowAutoConfiguration.java) | Configures a `XsuaaTokenFlows` bean for a given `RestOperations` and `XsuaaServiceConfiguration` bean to fetch the XSUAA service binding information. 

You can gradually replace auto-configurations as explained [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-auto-configuration.html).

#### XsuaaTokenFlows Initialization
To consume the `XsuaaTokenFlows` class, you simply need to `@Autowire` it like this:
```java
@Autowired
private XsuaaTokenFlows xsuaaTokenFlows;
```

For X.509 based authentication method using an externally managed certificate, `ClientCertificate` class needs to be instantiated with the external key. For `spring-xsuaa` based applications it can be easily done by overriding these values in `application.yml properties file.
```yaml
# For externally managed X.509 certificate
xsuaa:
  key: -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----YOUR PRIVATE KEY-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## Usage
The `XsuaaTokenFlows` provides a builder-pattern API that allows applications to easily create and execute each flow, guiding developers to only set properties that are relevant for the respective token flow.


### Client Credentials Token Flow
Obtain a client credentials token:

```java
OAuth2TokenResponse clientCredentialsToken = tokenFlows.clientCredentialsTokenFlow()
                                                    .subdomain(jwtToken.getSubdomain()) // this is optional - use zoneId alternatively
                                                    .disableCache(true)                 // optionally disables token cache for request
                                                    .execute();
```
### Refresh Token Flow
In case you have a refresh token and want to obtain an access token:

```java
OAuth2TokenResponse refreshToken = tokenFlows.refreshTokenFlow()
                              .refreshToken(<refresh_token>)
                              .subdomain(jwtToken.getSubdomain()) // this is optional
                              .disableCache(true)                 // optionally disables token cache for request
                              .execute();
```
### User Token Flow
In order to exchange a user token for another user access token:
```java
Token jwtToken = SpringSecurityContext.getToken();

OAuth2TokenResponse userToken = tokenFlows.userTokenFlow()
                .token(jwtToken)
                .subdomain(jwtToken.getSubdomain()) // optional, if not set it trys to extract zone Id from token
                .disableCache(true)                 // optionally disables token cache for request
                .attributes(additionalAttributes)   // this is optional
                .execute();
```


### Password Token Flow
In order to obtain an access token for a user:
```java
OAuth2TokenResponse clientCredentialsToken = tokenFlows.passwordTokenFlow()
                                                    .subdomain(jwtToken.getSubdomain()) 
                                                    .username(<your username>)
                                                    .password(<your password>)
                                                    .disableCache(true)  // optionally disables token cache for request
                                                    .execute();
```


Make sure to read the API documentation of the `XsuaaTokenFlows` API, to understand what the individual token flows' parameters are for.

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting problems with the token service, you can set the logging level for the 
`com.sap.cloud.security` package to `DEBUG`. Have a look at the 
[Logging](/java-security/README.md#logging) section for more information on logging.

If you need more detailed network data in your logs, you can also enable debugging for your HTTP client.
Note that this might leak encoded tokens into your logs. Use with care! 
For java applications using `HttpClient`, see the  
[logging documentation](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-4.5.x/logging.html).
For spring applications using rest template, you can set
`org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate` to log level `DEBUG`. 

### Common Pitfalls

- This module requires the [JSON-Java](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java) library.
If you have classpath related  issues involving JSON you should take a look at the
[Troubleshooting JSON class path issues](/docs/Troubleshooting_JsonClasspathIssues.md) document.

- `{\"error\":\"unauthorized\",\"error_description\":\"Unable to map issuer, [http://subdomain.localhost:8080/uaa/oauth/token] , to a single registered provider\"}`  
Token exchange is only supported within the same identity zone/tenant. That means, that you have to call the `/oauth/token` endpoint of the same subdomain, that was used for the original token. This can be achieved by configuring the user token flow the following way:
````
tokenFlows.userTokenFlow().token(jwtToken).subdomain(jwtToken.getSubdomain());`
````

- For Spring applications error like:
    ```java
    java.lang.IllegalStateException: Failed to load ApplicationContext 
    Caused by: org.springframework.beans.factory.UnsatisfiedDependencyException: Error creating bean with name 'securityConfiguration': Unsatisfied dependency expressed through field 'xsuaaTokenFlows'
    nested exception is java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/http/client/HttpClient
    ``` 
    make sure `org.apache.httpcomponents.httpclient` dependency is provided in the POM
